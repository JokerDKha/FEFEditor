# FEFEditor
FEFEditor is a general-purpose editor for Fire Emblem Fates. The program includes editors for most files that any aspiring ROM hacker would want to edit. This includes files related to adding in new characters, chapters, and supports.

Additionally, FEFEditor comes packaged with FEFNightmare and Fates Script. FEFNightmare uses a simple, text-based format to generate editors for files which do not need dedicated editors. Fates Script, as the name suggests, allows ROM hackers to decompile and compile scripts for use in Fire Emblem Fates.

# Features
- A support editor for giving characters additional supports and allowing new characters to support.
- An IndirectSound editor for editing combat voices.
- Terrain, Dispo, and Person editors for building new chapters.
- A dialogue editor to make adding in level up quotes and My Castle lines easier.
- A Castle Join editor for making new characters join through My Castle.
- FEFNightmare and Fates Script to cover smaller files and scripts.
- Alternative versions of the dialogue editor and support editor for DLC files.

# Dependencies
- FEFEditor comes bundled with a modified version of JMetro8 from the JFXtras project. JFXtras uses the new BSD license.
- The ToggleSwitch control comes from ControlsFX. ControlsFX also uses the new BSD license.
- Most of the editors included in FEFEditor use classes from another project of mine, FEFLib. FEFLib uses the MIT license.
